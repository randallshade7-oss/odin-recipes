        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This meaty goulash recipe is easy to make on the stovetop but can also be done 
            in a slow cooker. Inspired by Paula Deen's Bobby's Goulash.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
