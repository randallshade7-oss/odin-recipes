# Odin Recipes

## Description
In this project, I have created a simple recipe website. 
There is a home page that includes links to various recipes pages. 
We can navigate to a certain recipe by simply clicking those links. 
When we are on a certain recipe page, we can come back to the home page by clicking the 'Home' link on that page.

## Skills Demonstrated
- HTML: This website showcases a very basic HTML structure. The main elements used are **headings, paragraphs, lists, and links**.
